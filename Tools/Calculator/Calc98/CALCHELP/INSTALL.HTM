<h2>
Installing Calc98 on Windows NT, Windows95 or Windows98</h2>

The Calc98 files are compressed either as a self-extracting 
zip file (C98xxxx.exe) or as a zip file (C98xxxx.zip).
Self-extracting files can be unpacked by running the file 
(e.g. by double-clicking the icon).   
You can choose the directory where you want the files to go, 
or use the default (recommended).  Otherwise, the files can 
be unpacked using a utility such as zip, WinZip or PKUNZIP.

The self-extracting zip file will run a setup utility which
will add shortcuts to your Start menu or desktop.  If this
does not run automatically you can start it by double-clicking
on setup.exe in the Calc98 directory.

<p>Once the files are unpacked, Calc98 is ready to run. You can do this
by double clicking on the file <u>CALC.EXE</u> from "My Computer" or Explorer,
or using the shortcuts installed by setup.exe.  You can also manually
drag CALC.EXE onto the desktop to create a shortcut. You can right click
on the Start button, select Open, and drag CALC.EXE onto the Program folder
(or another folder if you prefer) to add Calc98 to the Start menu.
<h2>
Windows3.x</h2>
16-bit operating systems, such as Windows3.1, are not supported by Calc98.
There is a 16-bit version of Calc95 which can be downloaded from our web
site or from numerous archive sites, if you need to run a calculator program
on Windows3.x.
<h2>
WindowsCE</h2>
A version of Calc98 has been developed for WindowsCE. Please visit our
web site or contact us for more information or to download the WindowsCE
version.
<h2>
Calc98 Directory</h2>
It is suggested that you keep all the Calc98 files together in their own
directory. If you subsequently move the Calc98 component files around,
make sure Calc98 is run from its own directory, otherwise it may not be
able to locate some of the support files (e.g. FACTORY.PRP and help files).
<h2>
Uninstalling Calc98</h2>
If you need to remove Calc98 from your system simply delete the Calc98
directory and its contents.&nbsp; If you want to delete the entry from
the registry, then first run the calculator and select the Data page of
the Options dialog and click on the "Factory Setting" button.&nbsp; Click
the "Yes" button in the confirmation message, then quit the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can then delete the files.&nbsp; If you created any shortcuts&nbsp;
(e.g. on the desktop or Start Menu), you will need to remove these also.
