<h1>
About Calc98</h1>
Calc98 is a pocket calculator simulator program for the Microsoft Windows
operating systems. It can be used in place of the calculator program which
is included with the operating system, with many additional features and
greater flexibility.&nbsp; On handheld devices, it can be used in place
of a pocket calculator.&nbsp; It is especially designed for scientific
and engineering students and professionals and includes a wide range of
units conversions and scientific functions. It also has statistics, financial
and time functions, including a stopwatch.
<p>For information about new features in this release of Calc98, and known
outstanding issues, see the release note in the file <a href="release.htm">release.htm</a>.
<p>Calc98 is very compact in terms of screen space, so you can keep it
maximized while working within another application and make use of the
'always on top' option, or keep it in the system tray. You can also customize
the appearance of Calc98, including the resizing of buttons and their fonts
and layout.
