<h1>
Complex Numbers</h1>
You can carry out complex arithmetic by setting the number of I-direction
cells to exactly two, and checking the Complex box in the matrix page of
the Options dialog.
<p><img SRC="optcmplx.gif" BORDER=0 height=295 width=346>
<p>If the number of I-cells is set to some other value you are not allowed
to leave the dialog with Complex checked.&nbsp; If you set the number of
J-cells greater than one you can work with a one-dimensional array of complex
numbers.

<p>With complex numbers enabled, the column headings in the display are
"x" and "iy" to indicate the real and imaginary parts of each number.&nbsp;
On a desktop PC, you may want to re-configure the keypads to a landscape
layout for complex number arithmetic, because of the extra width needed
for the display.&nbsp; You can then adjust the size of the display so that
scroll bars are not needed.
<p>You can perform simple arithmetic on complex numbers, or perform exponentiation
and logarithm functions and transcendental functions.&nbsp; To enter numbers
select the real or imaginary parts as you would array elements as described
in the <a href="matrix.htm">section on arrays and matrices</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you select the real or imaginary part of a complex number, the arithmetic
logic acts on the whole of the complex number, not just the part selected.
<p>You can carry out "normal" calculations on real numbers as normal, simply
by setting the imaginary part to zero.&nbsp; Of course in certain cases
this may give rise to a complex number, for example, famously:
<p>Enter 1, then change its sign ("<b>+/-</b>").&nbsp; Result:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="30" BGCOLOR="#000099" >
<tr ALIGN=CENTER BGCOLOR="#008080">
<td><b><font color="#000000">x</font></b></td>

<td><b><font color="#000000">iy</font></b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b><font color="#66FFFF">-1.</font></b></td>

<td><b><font color="#66FFFF">0.</font></b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Now take the square root.&nbsp; Result:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="30" BGCOLOR="#000099" >
<tr>
<td><b><font color="#66FFFF">0.</font></b></td>

<td><b><font color="#66FFFF">1.</font></b></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Some examples are given below:

<h3>
Basic complex arithmetic.</h3>
The arithmetic functions act in the same way as for real numbers.&nbsp;
Complex addition is the same as array addition, but multiplication and
division are slightly more complicated.&nbsp; For example:
<p>(x<sub>1 </sub>+ i.y<sub>1</sub>)(x<sub>2</sub> + i.y<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;
=&nbsp; x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> + i.x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub> + i.x<sub>2</sub>y<sub>1</sub>
+ i <sup>2</sup>.y<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
= (x<sub>1</sub>x<sub>2</sub> -y<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub>) + i.(x<sub>1</sub>y<sub>2</sub>
+ x<sub>2</sub>y<sub>1</sub>)
<h3>
Complex plane.</h3>
To convert from real and imaginary components to modulus and argument in
the complex plane (Argand diagram), use the normal <b>r-p</b> and <b>p-r</b>
buttons.&nbsp; These are obtained by using the shift key when they replace
the "+" and "-" arithmetic buttons.&nbsp; Once converted, the calculator
does not "know" the values are in polar co-ordinates, and you must convert
back to cartesian form to continue calculations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The argument
will be expressed in degrees, radians or gradients depending on the angle
mode selected.
<p>Example:
<p>Visualizing complex numbers in the complex plane is a powerful way of
thinking about the real and imaginary components of numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The behaviour of arithmetic operations can be grasped more easily by considering
the geometric equivalents in the complex plane.&nbsp; For example, to take
the square root of a complex number, take the square root of the modulus
and divide the argument by two.&nbsp; You can verify this by using the
calculator to take the square root of various numbers and converting them
to polar co-ordinates.
<h3>
Logarithmic functions.</h3>
Logarithms, powers and roots work in the same way as for real numbers.
<h3>
Trigonometric functions.</h3>
Trigonometric functions work in the same way as for real numbers.
