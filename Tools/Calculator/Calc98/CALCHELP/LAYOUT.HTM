   <title>Calculator Layout</title>

<h1>
Calculator View</h1>
The calculator layout can be customised from the View tab of the Options
dialogue box. When experimenting with layout, you can use the Apply button
in the dialogue to see the effects of changes without leaving the dialogue
box.
<p>On a PC the overall size and shape of the calculator can be changed
by dragging the sides or corners to re-size the window. The keypads and
display automatically adjust themselves to fit the available space.&nbsp;
You can use this to make the calculator very small indeed, for example
leaving only the display visible, and using the <a href="accelmng.htm">keyboard
shortcuts</a> to control it.
<p><img SRC="optview.gif" ALT="layout page" height=294 width=347>
<p>The Layout tab allows you to specify the orientation of the two supported
keypads, Main and Function. Normally the Function keypad has a larger number
of smaller buttons than the Main keypad, which has the main arithmetic
keys.
<p>In addition you can specify the colour of the body of the calculator,
whether there is a bevel around the edge of the calculator window, and
whether or not a menu bar (or command bar) is required. The bevel is not
necessary from Windows95 onwards because the default windows already have
a bevelled appearance, but it improves the appearance on older versions
of Windows. The menu bar provides an alternative way of accessing some
of the functions of the calculator such as loading and saving data and
closing the application. All of the commands on the menu bar can be obtained
in other ways.
<p>Depending on your computer, you may see an additional "Choose HTML Browser"
button.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This allows you to select the browser to
use if the HTML Help engine cannot be found.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is
Microsoft Internet Explorer by default.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use this button to
locate Internet Explorer if it is not found automatically, or to select
another browser, e.g. Netscape.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows built in HTML Help
is always used in preference to a browser, so if you are using Windows98
or a later version of Windows an HTML browser would not normally be needed.
<h2>
<a NAME="keypad"></a>Keypad Buttons</h2>
There are buttons for the Main and Function keypads. The dialog boxes are
similar, and allow you to control the appearance of each keypad.
<p>It is possible to set the size of the keypad (i.e. number of rows and
columns of buttons) to show more buttons than are actually defined, and
this is in order to support future development of the software.&nbsp; Similarly,
you can reduce the size of the keypad or disable the function keypad altogether
for compactness.
<p><img SRC="keypad.gif" ALT="keypad page" >
<p>The button size and spacing between buttons are controlled by the two
groups of edit boxes on the right. The font button produces a dialogue
for selecting the font type and size. Note that some fonts (e.g. WingDings)
are not suitable as they do not contain alphanumeric characters.
<p>The appearance of tool tips (floating prompts) when the cursor lingers
over a button can be adjusted using the controls in the bottom left-hand
corner. They can be disabled completely, or the delay before showing them
can be changed as required. Tool tips are controlled separately for the
two keypads.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Landscape</h2>
Check this box for main and function keypads side by side.&nbsp; Otherwise
they are aligned vertically.
<h2>
Bevel</h2>
Checking this option causes a bevelled edge to be drawn around the calculator
body.&nbsp; This is redundant on current Windows desktop systems because
a bevel is drawn by the user interface of the operating system.
<h2>
Command Bar</h2>
This check box enables or disables the command bar which gives access to
menu items.&nbsp; It is possible to use the software without a command
bar, and many users prefer not to have it.
<h2>
Start Minimised</h2>
If you check this box the next time the program starts it will be minimised
to an icon.&nbsp; This option is particularly useful if you choose to have
the calculator start up automatically with Windows (by putting a shortcut
in the <b>/Windows/StartMenu/Programs/StartUp</b> directory).
<h2>
Task bar Tray Icon</h2>
This option causes the calculator to minimise as an icon in the Task bar
Tray.&nbsp; You can combine this with Start Minimised as described above
so that the calculator is always running and readily accessible while you
are working at the computer.
<h2>
Hide after..</h2>
The <i>auto power off</i> feature means that after a specified number of
seconds of inactivity the calculator minimizes itself.
<h2>
Always On Top</h2>
The <i>always on top</i> option keeps the calculator as the top-most window
at all times. It can still be minimized.&nbsp; This is useful if you are
using it in conjunction with an application that needs to use the whole
screen area, so that the calculator "floats" on top.
<h2>
Error Beep</h2>
The calculator gives a beep sound if an error occurs. This can be disabled
by this check box.
<h2>
Example:</h2>
Using the options described above, the appearance of the calculator can
be greatly changed from the default to suit personal preference and screen
resolution. See the <a href="display.htm">Display</a> Tab for more information
about changing the appearance of the display.
