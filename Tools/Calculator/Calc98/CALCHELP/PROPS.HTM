<h1>
Properties and Constants</h1>
To get the value of a constant, click the&nbsp;<img SRC="buttons/cnst.gif" ALT="cnst" height=23 width=33>
button to get the constants dialog box.
<p><img SRC="constant.gif" ALT="constants" BORDER=0 height=198 width=349>
<p>Select the required property using the drop down list.&nbsp; You may
need to use the scroll bar.
<p><img SRC="cnstlist.gif" BORDER=0 height=224 width=348>
<p>Next, select the required units if required.&nbsp; This can also be
done later.
<p><img SRC="cnstunit.gif" height=245 width=349>
<p>Then select the desired constant from the Constants list box.
<p><img SRC="earth.gif" height=291 width=350>
<p>When you have selected a constant its value can be seen in the box below.
<p><img SRC="constval.gif" height=198 width=348>
<p>If you want to put the value into the calculator display, click OK.
To quit without changing the calculator display, click Cancel. Note that
for some properties the there are no constants in the database.&nbsp; You
can <a href="editprop.htm">add your own properties, constants and units</a>,
or modify or delete the existing ones.
<p>If you are looking for a property or constant (or even units) but cannot
find them, you can use the <a href="findprop.htm">Find button</a> to search
the properties database.
<h3>
Built-in Periodic Table of the Elements</h3>
The Element button brings up a periodic table of the elements.
<p><img SRC="periodic.gif" >
<p>Clicking on an element brings up more detailed information.
<p><img SRC="uranium.gif" height=271 width=229>
<p>The full name of the element and its family are shown along with its
valency.&nbsp;&nbsp; Symbols show the element's state at room temperature,
and whether it is radioactive or toxic.&nbsp; The atomic number, weight,
and physical properties are also shown in buttons.&nbsp; If the button
is pressed, you are taken back to the constants dialog box with the property
automatically selected.&nbsp; You can then click on the OK button in the
normal way to transfer this data to the calculator.

<h2>
Special Properties</h2>
Some constants associated with your computer or device can be found in
the dimensionless and time properties. Some of these are not really "constants"
at all and may return a different value each time they are used.
<p>For the property "time" you will find the CPU time and current time
as well as the year, month, day of the month, and day of the week.&nbsp;
You may need to select appropriate units to make sense of these.
<p>Under the property "dimensionless", you can find values for our copyright
year and the software version number, and a random number generator.
<p>In addition there is a pseudo-constant for CPU performance called "CPU
mips".&nbsp;&nbsp; Selecting this invokes a very simple CPU calibration
algorithm which measures the performance of your processor.&nbsp; The performance
measure is weighted towards floating point performance and is very approximate
and should not, for example, be relied upon as the basis for choosing a
computer.&nbsp; It is interesting however as a rough comparison between
different devices.&nbsp; The number given is approximately the equivalent
of the number of millions of instructions per second, bearing in mind that
there is no precise equivalence between the meaning of an instruction between
different processor architectures.
<p>For comparison we give comparable performance numbers for some computers,
old and new:
