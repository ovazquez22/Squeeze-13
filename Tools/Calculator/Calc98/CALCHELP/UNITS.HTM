Units Conversions</h1>
The calculator has in-built units conversions and <a href="props.htm">constants</a>.
Using conventional calculators and reference books it is often difficult
to find a conversion factor between the pair of units you are dealing with
and you are forced to convert in several error prone steps. This problem
is eliminated with the units conversion facility. The conversion function
also eliminates the risk of confusion about 'which way' to use a factor
that arises when converting between different units systems of dimensionally
complex quantities.

<p>Suppose you have a value for a property, dynamic viscosity say, quoted
in non-SI units, and the formula you are computing is in SI.&nbsp; First,
enter the value into the calculator display. Next, click the <b>unit</b>
button and select the property <i>dynamic viscosity</i> from the Properties
box.

<p>Then in the From box select the set of units in which the value has
been entered (e.g. slug/ft-sec).&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select the desired units
in the To box. If the desired units are SI, you can just click the SI button,
rather than searching for them in the drop down edit box. Finally click
the OK button (or return on the keyboard) and the converted value will
be shown in the calculator display.

<p>You can click the Cancel button to return to the calculator without
performing any conversion.
<p>Now that the conversion has been set up, you can use the same conversion
on another value using the "<b>cnv></b>" button.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any value
can now be instantly converted from slug/ft.s to kg/m.s using this button.&nbsp;
To convert back from kg/m.s to slug/ft.s use the <b>shift</b> button which
changes the "<b>cnv></b>" button to "<b>&lt;cnv</b>", which does the reverse
conversion.
<p>You can use the <a href="findprop.htm">Find button</a> to search for
a property or units from the properties database.
<br>To <a href="editprop.htm">modify the properties database</a> press
the <b>Edit</b> button next to the properties or units.
