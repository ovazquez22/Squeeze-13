Miscellaneous Functions</h1>

<h2>
Stopwatch</h2>
In <b>Time</b> mode, buttons are available to control a simple stopwatch.
<p><img SRC="stopwtch.gif" ALT="stopwatch mode" >
<p>To start the stopwatch use the <b>start</b> button, which results in
increasing time being displayed. This continues until one of the other
stopwatch buttons is pressed. The calculator cannot be used for other calculations
unless the stopwatch is stopped or set to lap count.
<p>To stop the watch, use the <b>stop</b> button. Pressing <b>start</b>
again will cause the watch to resume from the time when it was stopped.
Pressing the <b>lap</b> button while it is running freezes the display
without stopping the watch. When the <b>start</b> button is pressed again,
the display continues, showing the accumulated time. Once <b>lap</b> has
been pressed the calculator can be used for other calculations, for example
saving the lap time to a memory.
<p>If <b>reset</b> is pressed, the stopwatch is set back to zero. The next
time <b>start</b> is pressed the watch will commence at zero.
<p>Pressing <b>count</b> starts a countdown from the currently displayed
time. This can be the result of a previous stopwatch time, or the start
time can be entered using the keypad. When the countdown reaches zero the
stopwatch beeps if "Error Beep" is enabled (see <a href="modes.htm">Modes</a>).
<p>The <b>now</b> button sets the display to the current (local) time at
the instant the button is pressed.&nbsp; If you need a clock, click on
<b>now</b>
immediately followed by <b>start</b> which will result in a continuous
display of the current time.
<p>The accuracy of the stopwatch may be limited by the hardware device
on which it is running. On WindowsCE devices the accuracy is nominally
plus or minus 25mS. The stopwatch accuracy is maintained even if the device
is switched off, or goes into the suspended state. The nominal accuracy
on Windows is plus or minus 1 mS.
<p>In time mode, some of the functions described above can be operated
from the cursor (arrow) keys on your keyboard.&nbsp; On Pocket PC devices
there is sometimes a cursor device which performs the same function - for
example on the Compaq iPaq there is a four-way control pad which functions
in the same way as the cursor keys.&nbsp; This makes it possible to operate
the stopwatch single-handed.
<p>The arrow keys are mapped as follows:

<h2>
ASCII Converter</h2>
In Binary, Octal, Hexadecimal or Base-N modes, you can use the <b>ascii</b>
button to bring up a table of ASCII values. The values correspond to the
number base being used. Selecting a value followed by <b>OK</b> will result
in the value for that character being input to the calculator.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Click on Cancel if you want to check an ASCII value without entering its
value.
<p><img SRC="ascii.gif" ALT="ASCII" >
<p>The example above shows the decimal values for some of the ASCII codes.
These were obtained by selecting Base-N mode with a base of 10, as explained
in the <a href="modes.htm">Modes</a> section.
<p>The control chars (0 - 31) show the control sequence and the control
character name.
<h2>
Saving and Restoring Data</h2>
The Data tab of the Options dialog is used to save and restore calculator
data.
<p><img SRC="optdata.gif" ALT="data" height=293 width=347>
<p>Data values, including the contents of memory and arrays or matrices,
can be saved to or loaded from file using the <b>Save</b> and <b>Load</b>
buttons. They result in a further dialog box to select the filename.
<p>Physical properties, constants and conversions <a href="editprop.htm">can
also be saved or loaded</a>.
<p>There is a also a button which allows you to choose the HTML browser
which is invoked when you click on the <b>help</b> button.&nbsp; This can
be used to find a browser if it cannot be located automatically, or if
you prefer to choose a browser other than the default.
<p>The default browser is located by searching for each of the following
in turn:
<ul>
<li>
The Windows HTML Help application (Hh)</li>

<li>
Microsoft Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe)</li>

<li>
Web viewer on older CE devices (webview.exe)</li>

<li>
Netscape Navigator (netscape.exe)</li>

<li>
Windows CE help (peghelp.exe)</li>
</ul>
If none of these turns up a browser, you are prompted to locate one.&nbsp;
If all else fails, you can start your browser and open the file "index.htm"
in the "CalcHelp" directory which will be in the directory where you installed
the software.

<h2>
<a NAME="factory"></a>Reverting to "Factory" Settings</h2>
Whenever you change the calculator settings using the Options dialog, or
close down the calculator, the configuration is saved to the Windows Registry.&nbsp;
The Windows Registry is simply a mechanism for storing data which is part
of the operating system.&nbsp; By using the registry, it is possible for
an application to maintain a different set of configurations for different
users.
<p>Sometimes you may want to force the settings back to those when the
software was first installed.&nbsp; This is analogous to the standard configuration
of a piece of equipment when it leaves the factory, which are often called
the "factory settings".&nbsp; Unfortunately, if you simply delete the directory
containing the software and all the associated files, and then re-install
the software, the "remembered" settings will still be in the registry and
will be picked up when the application is started.
<p>The registry is not part of the file system, and is quite difficult
to modify.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a special tool called <i>regedit</i> which
usually has to be run by typing the name or finding the file in the Windows
directory.&nbsp; It is not normally accessible from the Start menu or Control
Panel.&nbsp; The reason is that the registry contains parameters which
control the way the operating system works, and it is quite easy to accidentally
make the system unuseable while editing it.&nbsp; If you ever need to manually
edit the registry settings, or <i>keys</i> (which we do not recommend),
they can be found under the key <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/FlowSimulation</b>.
<p>If you simply want to get rid of the registry settings, for example
to start afresh, there is a button on the Options/Data page labelled "Factory
Setting".&nbsp; This will remove the registry entry and prevent its being
rewritten when you close down the calculator.&nbsp; You will be warned
that the registry setting will be deleted - answer "Yes" to this question.&nbsp;
You should then close the calculator (if it is in the system tray you will
need to click on its icon and choose Exit).&nbsp; If you continue, any
further changes you make to the configuration will be lost.&nbsp; If you
enter the Options dialog again, you will be warned of this.
<p>The next time you run the calculator, it will have the "factory" settings,
as if run for the first time.&nbsp; Note that any data in the calculator
will still be there, because this is stored in a separate file (default.dat).&nbsp;
Also, if you have added to the properties database and saved in default.dat,
this will be loaded also.&nbsp; If you want to completely revert to the
original settings you need to do the following:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Delete the registry key as described above</li>

<li>
Remove the file default.dat from the calculator directory</li>

<li>
Remove the file default.prp from the calculator directory (if present)</li>
</ul>
Note that on some WindowsCE devices files are saved in "My Documents" instead
of the calculator directory.
