Calculator Basics - RPN</h1>
You can configure the calculator to use <a href="rpn.htm">Reverse Polish
Notation (RPN) </a>using the calculator "opt" button and selecting the
"mode" tab.&nbsp; This gives you the option of selecting algebraic logic
(the default), "as entered" (arithmetic operators are applied in the order
entered regardless of the rules of operator precedence) or RPN.
<p><img SRC="calcrpn.gif" BORDER=0 height=354 width=236>
<p>The layout is very similar to the algebraic logic mode.&nbsp; Instead
of the "=" button there is a button marked "Ent" for "Enter".&nbsp; The
memory buttons are now called "STO" (store) and "RCL" (recall) and pop
up a dialogue box to select the memory number.&nbsp; There is a button
"CLx" which clears the value at the top of the stack, and "REG" which clears
all the registers.
<p>Example:
<br><b>1 Ent 2 Ent 3 Ent 4 Ent&nbsp; </b>would push the values 1, 2, 3
and 4 onto the stack
<br>Repeatedly pressing the + button would pop each value off the stack
in turn, adding it to the total, finally resulting in the answer 10.

<p>If you click on the&nbsp;<img SRC="buttons/shift.gif" height=23 width=33>
button you get three further RPN functions.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<img SRC="buttons/stack.gif" height=23 width=33>
button allows you to view the contents of the stack (because of the way
the internal logic works you will see the top of the stack (or X) in positions
0 and 1).&nbsp; If you click on one of the numbered buttons, the corresponding
value will be added to the top of the stack.
<p>There is an&nbsp;<img SRC="buttons/exchgXY.gif" ALT="x<>y" height=23 width=33>
button which switches the top two values in the stack.&nbsp; And the stack
roll down button&nbsp;<img SRC="buttons/rolldown.gif" height=30 width=40>
will pop a value off the stack and move all the other values up.
