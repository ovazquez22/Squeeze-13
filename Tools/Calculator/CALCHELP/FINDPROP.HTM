Searching for Constants and Properties</h1>
If you are looking for a property, unit or constant but cannot find them,
you can use the Find button to search the properties database.&nbsp; The
Find button is in both the Constants and the Units Conversions dialog boxes.&nbsp;
Enter a search word or part word and click OK.
<p><img SRC="cnstfind.gif" height=96 width=216>
<p>The next property, unit or constant matching the search will be displayed,
if found.&nbsp; You can continue searching for further occurrences using
the Find Next button until no more matches can be found.&nbsp; In the example
above the search will find various physical properties of water, but also
units containing the term "water", for example inches of water as a measure
of pressure.
<p>Some of the properties use scientific names, such as "mass", which are
not always the ones in common use.&nbsp; For example someone wishing to
convert kitchen measures is more likely to be thinking in terms of "weights"
than, say what "mass" of flour is required to bake a cake.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you search for the word "weight" for example, you will find the property
"mass" because the database stores the common names for most properties.&nbsp;
You can see these common names (or aliases) when you edit units.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They are separated by semicolons, and only the first is normally shown.
