Calc98 for Windows
------------------

Calc98 is a Scientific/Engineering calculator with
units conversions and physical properties.
Statistics, financial, array and matrix functions.  
It supports algebraic or RPN logic, and
customisable size, fonts, layout and appearance.

The Calc98 files are compressed either as a self-extracting 
zip file (C98xxxx.exe) or as a zip file (C98xxxx.zip).
Self-extracting files can be unpacked by running the 
file (e.g. by double-clicking the icon).   
You can choose the directory where you want the files to go, 
or use the default (recommended).  Otherwise, the files can 
be unpacked using a utility such as zip, WinZip or PKUNZIP.

The self-extracting zip file will run a setup utility which
will give you the option to add shortcuts to your Start menu 
or desktop.  If this does not run automatically you can start 
it by double-clicking on setup.exe in the Calc98 directory.

Please read the licence terms and other information in the file 
Readme.htm in the CalcHelp directory.  Further installation 
instructions are in the file Install.htm and information about
